        <h3 class="title"> Pi Sigma Epsilon Regional Confernce</h3>
        <p class="story"><img>
            November 10th-13th, Pi Sigma Epsilon professional business
            fraternity attended their yearly regional conference
            in Kalamazoo, Michigan. For 3 days our members competed in
            business competitions in front of over 20 corporate sponsors and against 12 other Pi Sigma Epsilon chapters across the midwest. The 4 business competitions consisted of a marketing challenge, sports selling, speakers competition, and the most competitive: pro-am sell-athon.
            The second biggest competition, speakers comp, allows students the opportunity to give a 5 minute “ted-talk” like speech on a topic introduced beforehand in a room of 200 people. The biggest competition, pro-am sell-athon, brought 64 competitors each attempting to sell the same item to an interested buyer in a 12 minute mock sales meeting.
