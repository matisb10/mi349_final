        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p><img class="headshot" src="headshot.jpg" alt="headshot of editor"></p>
        <p class="line">Hello everybody! I am Matis Butlevics, current senior at Michigan State University majoring in Supply Chain Management and minoring in Information Technology. I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan and lived there all my life before coming to MSU. I have always had an interest in web design and web capabilities due to the creative nature and the amount of opportunity you can control at your fingertips. Next year I will be moving to the big city in Chicago where I will be working for a consulting firm called Crowe on their cloud solutions team.</p>
        <p class="line">I have always been involved here at MSU taking part in the SCMA for 2 years, being a Broad Business student mentor for 1 year, and recently taking up the role of President for the professional business fraternity of Pi Sigma Epsilon. I participate in IM teams every semester, mainly basketball, soccer, and volleyball, and have made many great friends along the way! I am happy to have been a spartan and remain a spartan for one more semester until graduation. MSU has given me the opportunity to travel, meet new people, and experience things I previously never thought attainable for myself, I will sure miss this place when I am gone.</p>
        <h5>Inspiration</h5>
        <p class="line">My inspiration for this platform all started with my presidency for my professional organization here on campus at MSU. From there I was invited onto the Broad Business President’s council made up of respected Presidents from across the organizations affiliated with Broad Business School. We would have meetings and give each other updates on what our organizations have been accomplishing and then an overview of some of our upcoming events. I thought to myself, why isn’t there a single place where we can provide all of this information freely to each other without having to wait a month for all of us to meet. That is where the idea was sparked.</p>
        <p class="line">The content of the platform is meant to be fully produced by the users, with a single mediator filtering out any of the explicit or phony information. Michigan State provides many different news services that keep tabs on organizations such as the one I am in but rarely check in and are merely reported on instead of allowing the members of the organizations control the story. So SpartanSuitcase is more of an informal but informative place for all the professional organizations to come together without having to be in the same room and still being able to collaborate effectively. I hope you all find use out of SpartanSuitcase and submit your stories and events to display!
